# A-Virtual-Whiteboard

This project is about making a virtual whiteboard that works on computers, tablets, or phones. It allows users to draw, write, erase, and use different colors and pen sizes, just like a real 
whiteboard. It is very helpful for online classes, group studies, and presentations. Students and teachers can use it to explain topics easily and clearly. The whiteboard can also be cleared or saved. It is simple to use, interactive, and makes learning more fun and effective in a digital way.
